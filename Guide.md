# 🛡️ Opt-Out Guide (People Search / Data Broker Sites)
> A visual, step-by-step guide to remove your info from common people-search sites.
## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Find your profile on the site (search your name + city/state).
2. Copy the exact profile URL.
3. Use the site’s opt-out page and submit removal.
4. Confirm via email/phone if required.
5. Re-check in 24–72 hours and repeat if multiple listings appear.
## ✅ Before You Begin (Checklist)
- [ ] Use a fresh browser tab (incognito/private helps).
- [ ] Have your email ready (some sites require confirmation).
- [ ] Keep a notes file with: site + profile URL + date submitted.
- [ ] If you’re listed multiple times, you usually must remove each listing separately.
## 🧰 Pro Tips
- 🧠 Search smarter: try `"First Last" + city` and also just phone number.
- 🧹 Clear cookies or use private mode if the site loops or blocks.
- 🔁 Set a reminder to re-check in 7–14 days (some sites republish).
- 📸 Screenshot confirmations for your records.
